# Last War Roster Scanner v2

A browser based roster scanner and event assignment planner. Created by Lady Jess.

## Start the app

Open `index.html` in a modern Chrome or Edge browser. No build step or local server is required. An internet connection is needed to load Tesseract.js for OCR.

## Features

- Scan Last War roster screenshots to identify Team A and Team B, player role, name, power, and participant or substitute status.
- Support differently positioned team selectors, including Canyon Storm screenshots with the faction banner, plus a German language interface example.
- Review and edit extracted entries, learn OCR name corrections, and detect potential duplicates.
- Plan up to 20 active participants per team, with separate Phase 1 and Phase 2 assignments and player swaps.
- Generate downloadable assignment maps, including embedded Desert Storm and Canyon Storm templates.
- Configure event priority slots and map label positions, with backup and restore of event settings.
- Switch between English, French, German, Italian, Danish, and Spanish. Generated maps, CSV and clipboard output remain in English.
- Toggle light and dark themes.

## Repository layout

- `index.html`: Entire web app, including styles, UI, application logic, and embedded map templates.
- `config/default_events.json`: Reference backup for the built in Desert Storm and Canyon Storm defaults. The app also embeds these settings in `index.html`, so this JSON file is provided for inspection and manual import.

## Storage and privacy

Roster screenshots are read locally in the browser, not uploaded to a server. Event configurations, OCR name dictionary, and preferences are stored in the browser's local storage. Browser data is not automatically synchronized across devices. Export JSON backups when moving to another device.

## Notes

This version includes the Canyon Storm faction banner OCR layout correction. OCR accuracy can vary by screenshot dimensions, compression, and game language; manually review the resulting roster before using it for an event.
